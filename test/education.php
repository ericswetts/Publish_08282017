<p>In 2012, I completed my B.A. in Urban Studies, with a concentration in community organization and a minor in Africana Studies, from the University of
Pittsburghâ€™s Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences. My degree prepared me to join the non-profit sector to complete work related to community organizing,
economic development, and capacity-building in economically depressed communities.  A core component of my studies was the study of race in the American
context, the exploration of intersecting identities and how they pertain to privilege, and the legacy of oppression of black Americans. This education served as a foundation for my
    interest in the social determinants of health, and would steer my educational interests moving forward. </p>



<p>In 2017, I completed my Master of Public Health (MPH) degree from the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. This education built on my
undergraduate education, helping me understand not only what health disparities exist, but providing the frameworks and skillsets necessary to address them.
